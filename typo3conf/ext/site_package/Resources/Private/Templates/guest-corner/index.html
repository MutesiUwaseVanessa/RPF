      <p class="post-excerpt pb-3">
        Rwanda is often accurately described as “the small East African
        nation.” Yet, largely because of its recent history, when it comes
        to global peacekeeping, the country’s footprint is larger than that
        of nations many times its size.

        It is now 30 years since the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF-Inkotanyi)

        <a href="">From startup to scale-up: How Rwanda's initiatives are redefining
          entrepreneurship

      </p>

      <p class="post-excerpt pb-3">
        Someone once told me that having an idea is one thing, but turning a
        startup into a scale-up is a different game altogether. While most
        startups crumble by their fifth year, Rwanda’s government policies
        and support programs are rewriting this narrative, making Rwandan
        entrepreneurs the exception rather than the rule.
